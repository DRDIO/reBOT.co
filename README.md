========

Introduction
------------

reBOT.co is a web-based social game where players wander a post Utopian society as lost robots in search of starting their own civilizations. It is realtime and web-based, utilizing HTML5, jQuery, Canvas, CSS3, node.js, and Socket.IO. It will integrate with existing social networks through OAuth, when the moment strikes.

Setup
-----

Clone the repo and click /public/index.html. Congratulations, you are playing the development version of reBOT.co! As we progress in development, the setup procedures will become more complex, involving node.js and socket.IO setup along with basic knowledge of running a Linux server. But for now, easy jQuery goodness!
